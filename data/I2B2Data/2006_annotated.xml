PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Unstable angina .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12-6</PHI>-93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> 1993 for chronic angina .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .
There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .
There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .
However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .
She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .
In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .
During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-11</PHI>-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .
Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .
The electrolytes were normal .
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12-6</PHI>-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .
The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .
But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .
The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .
The patient did well post procedure .
He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .
The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .
The blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .
The patient was ambulating without symptoms .
ADDENDUM :
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
This fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .

She was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .
She will be followed by her physician at <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Cean</PHI> , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Dieseld Pollejesc</PHI> , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .
